- **Unsplash API**: Real food images

## Browser Compatibility

Works on all modern browsers:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## How It Works

1. Orders are stored in browser localStorage (simulating a backend)
2. Real-time communication between customer and owner via notifications
3. Auto-refresh functionality to show latest updates
4. Customer gets notifications when owner updates order status
5. Owner gets notifications when customer places new order

## Future Enhancements

- Backend integration with database
- Real authentication system
- Payment gateway integration
- Delivery tracking
- Multiple location support
- Inventory management
- Customer reviews and ratings

## Notes

- This is a demo system using localStorage for simplicity
- In production, this would require a proper backend with database
- Images are loaded from Unsplash (may require internet connection)
- Data persists in browser localStorage
- **Owner Login Credentials** (for demo):
  - Email: owner@hotel.com
  - Password: admin123
- Owner dashboard is protected by authentication
- Customers can rate completed orders with star ratings (1-5 stars)

## QR Code Usage

### QR Codes Already Generated!

âœ… **QR codes have been generated for you!**

- `qr_menu.png` - QR code for the hotel menu
- `qr_orders.png` - QR code for the orders page
- `qr-display.html` - Beautiful display page with both QR codes

### View and Print QR Codes

1. **Open `qr-display.html`** in your browser to see both QR codes
2. Click the "Print" button to print QR codes for restaurant tables
3. Place printed QR codes on each table for customers to scan

### How QR Code Works

1. **QR Codes Generated**: QR codes point to:
   - Menu page: `index.html?mode=customer`
   - Orders page: `order-status.html?mode=customer`

2. **Customer Experience**: When customers scan the QR code:
   - They can only access the menu and their orders
   - Owner pages are completely blocked
   - Cannot access owner login or dashboard
   - Seamless ordering experience

3. **For Web Deployment**: Update URLs in `generate_qr_codes.py`:
   ```python
   menu_url = "http://yourdomain.com/index.html?mode=customer"
   orders_url = "http://yourdomain.com/order-status.html?mode=customer"
   ```
   Then run: `python generate_qr_codes.py`

4. **Protection**: The `mode=customer` parameter ensures:
   - No access to owner dashboard
   - No access to owner login
   - Clean customer-only interface

## Getting Started

### For Development
Simply open `index.html` in your web browser to start using the menu system!

### For Production with QR Code
1. Deploy all files to a web server
2. Create QR codes pointing to your menu URL with `?mode=customer` parameter
3. Place QR codes on restaurant tables
4. Customers scan and order directly from their phones
